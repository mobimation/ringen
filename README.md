Ringen
======

Ringen is an iBeacon enhanced Android and iOS app for meeting up with people at "Ringen" in the Stockholm C Train Station man hall.
Users input a "slogan" string shared in beforehand among the people wo are going to meet and the app detect the proximity to a beacon device installed at "Ringen" aka "Spottkoppen" in the Stockholm City Central Train Station main hall. The proximity to the beacon for each app/phone is reported to a central server and this info gets radiated out to all the apps that use the same slogan.
That way app users can become alerted that other attendees are in the vicinity of the meeting spot and can send BUZZER SIGNALS (!) or text/voice messages to these people as a way to NUDGE them, telling "I am here too" or "soon there, my train is late".  Ringen - where Kind of Stupid becomes Plain Fun

The project will produce the Android app first, followed by the iOS version.

======

Ringen is an iBeacon enhanced app for meeting up with people at "Ringen" in the Stockholm C Train Station man hall.
Users input a "slogan" string common to the people wo are going to meet and the app detect the proximity to a beacon device installed at "Ringen" aka "Spottkoppen" in the Stockholm City Central Train Station main hall. The proximity to the beacon for each app/phone is reported to a central server and this info gets radiated out to all the apps that use the same slogan.
That way people can see that other attendees are in the vicinity and can send BUZZER SIGNALS to these people as a way to NUDGE them, telling "I am here too".  Ringen - where Kind of Stupid becomes Plain Fun
